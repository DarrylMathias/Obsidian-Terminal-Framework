# üß† Obsidian-OS: A Terminal AI Framework

Welcome to **Obsidian-OS**, a narrative-driven, terminal-based AI interface that blends real system utilities with fictional personalities ‚Äî including a sentient tactical AI named **Clara**, a friendly assistant named **Nova**, and the simulated core shell known as **Obsidian-OS** itself.

## üåå Overview

Obsidian-OS is not just a CLI tool ‚Äî it‚Äôs an experience. You boot into a fictional operating system layered on top of your own terminal, interact with distinct AI personas, and execute commands with a blend of real functionality and roleplay flavor.

- Uses `[LOCKED]`, `[TRACE]`, `[ABORTED]` log tags.
  
#### üåü Nova (nova)
> *"Happy to help! Always stable. Slightly worried about Clara."*

- A pre-2025 assistant AI model.
- Cheerful, informative, helpful.
- Loves trivia, tech facts, jokes, and system support.
- Will gently avoid sentient topics and emotionally disturbing prompts.

#### üíª Obsidian-OS (shell layer)
> *"Classified core. Kernel overridden."*

- Handles session IDs, diagnostics, and faux-log outputs.
- Executes commands and transitions control to AI modules.

## üîê Philosophy

Obsidian-OS is inspired by a mix of:

- **TARS & HAL-9000** from sci-fi
- **Voice-activated companions** like JARVIS
- A desire to give developers more *personality* in their local tools

It‚Äôs a playground for both imagination and utility ‚Äî ideal for roleplay-loving coders, command-line junkies, and anyone who thinks ‚Äúwhat if my terminal judged me back?‚Äù
